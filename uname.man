Unix utility 'uname'

The Unix utility 'uname' is responsible for displaying system information, displaying Hexagon(R)
and Hexagonix(R) kernel information.
For this purpose, the utility can receive parameters, in order to display specific information
for the user. These parameters are:

 -a: Display all possible system, kernel, and machine information.
 -s: Name of the running kernel.
 -n: Display the hostname of the machine running the system.
 -r: Launch the running kernel.
 -v: Running kernel version.
 -m: Machine type.
 -p: System processor architecture.
 -i: System hardware platform.
 -o: Name of the running operating system.

In the absence of parameters, the '-s' option will be selected automatically.

For more information, enter 'uname ?' or 'uname --help'.

You can also use 'arch' and 'hostname' to get this information.
Use 'man arch' or 'man hostname' for more information.
